<FONT SIZE="7"> Base form . Goku spends the majority of his time throughout each Dragon Ball series in this form, his natural-born state. However, in base form, he is at his lowest level of power. In an important fight, Goku often discounts this form in order to transform into something far more powerful. That doesn't mean he still isn't a force to be reckoned with..<FONT SIZE="7"/> <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

The interesting thing about Goku and SSJ2 is that this is the only time he didn’t get a new Saiyan transformation first. He was the first to get SSJ1, SSJ3, SSG, SSB and Ultra Instinct. It marks a brief period when Goku wasn’t the king of the universe, and Gohan was stronger for a short period until Goku would play catch up. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
